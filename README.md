# plain-javascript
A webpage without frameworks.

Files are located in "files" folder. Pleas add it by hand since it's gitignored.

It's full of code pieces and stuff for now. Also ugly af.
 
This first release is like version 1.0 I guess. I would call it 0.1 first, but for this particular project I don't really know. Have fun, or, as italians would say, have THE fun with it.

I would like to thank w3schools.
